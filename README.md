# Robotics-Systems

Robotics and Mechatronics Systems C++ Coursework.

Written in C++. the brief was designed to simulate what might be needed on a robot or embeded system to read data from 3 sensors and manipulate this data in order to create a control output for 2 motors.

Code was written in Xcode, and so the Xcode project is included in this repo.

The system architect is shown in the figure
